# FEATURES

- MacOS Support
- Remove new ROBLOX cursor and replace with old one in under a second
- Works before or in a ROBLOX game, no need to worry about corruption
- Node.JS binary precompiled for supported platforms
- Completely FREE
- Handy automated tool


# TO BE ADDED

- Windows support
  - Will be fixed by fetching latest ROBLOX version, checking if that version exists on your PC and if not, prompts you to install it
  - Will work under wine for full Linux support under [Grapejuice](https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice)
- Linux support
  - ROBLOX doesn't have a native Linux version, but having a Linux compiled binary that checks for the ROBLOX WINEPREFIX, and edits the files will be less of a pain to run
- For less tech-savvy users, a complete UI for replacing new cursor images, probably electron w/ support for Windows, MacOS and Linux
- Add --revert option to put back new cursor
  - This will require the tool copying the default cursor images to backup directory, then replacing old files (easy to add)
- Support for custom cursors, probably GUI only


And much more!

# IMPORTANT NOTES

- As I'm developing on MacOS, my priorities will almost always be on this version, so expect MacOS to have the most support.
- Native Linux binary is my lowest priority, due to the Windows version working on wine.
