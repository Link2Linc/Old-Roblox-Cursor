# Old-Roblox-Cursor-GUI

To be implemented [here](https://github.com/Link2Linc/Old-Roblox-Cursor) (sike, that was a lie.)
Because of troubles implementing a GUI and TUI version w/ NodeJS, I just decided to not do it. Sometime in the future, it will be implemented.

Head over [here to the releases section](https://github.com/Link2Linc/Old-Roblox-Cursor-GUI)
