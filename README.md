# Roblox-Cursor-Restore

When Roblox updates they overwrite everything, including the Roblox cursor pack. I personally like the old cursor, so after every update, run this tool.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: MacOS IS ONLY SUPPORTED
Windows support is coming, but due to everchanging folder version name, i dont want to have to update it every single week
